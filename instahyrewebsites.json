Over the years, we have built on our humble beginnings - from a simple idea - to innovative products that help people get work done faster, together.</p>  <p><br /></p>  <p>When SDP Labs was started back in 2007, a few things were certain: we loved Internet, Simplicity, Technology and wanted to help people get more work done faster. We always longed for that one place wherein we could convert our ideas into reality and wanted to have fun while doing so. But because we couldn't find a place to do all of that, we decided to create one.</p>  <p><br /></p>  <p>In the years that followed, we evolved, gained perspective, and created what we always felt the need of. 1 product turned into many. Employees became family. Clients became friends. And, our work became our lifeline. Each time our clients place their trust in us, we pass that trust on to our employees, and our employees give it back to our clients by delivering innovative solutions and outstanding service. With that mindset, we've helped hundreds of businesses and start-ups improve the way they work.</p>  <p><br /></p>  <p>And, as we move forward we have set our sights high on being worthy, innovative and informed problem-solvers who aren't afraid of getting their hands dirty. Our thanks goes out to our clients and users who have helped us get this far, and for their priceless suggestions that have shaped who we are as a brand in this community.</p>  <p><br /></p>  <p>Our main product is ProofHub, an advanced online project management software & collaboration tool that, with advanced features like task management, file sharing, gantt charts, chat and more, helps you in managing your projects easily.</p></body></html>",

Launch a high-quality live stream to Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and LinkedIn Live while interviewing guests and sharing the screen with just a few clicks. Record podcasts with our local recording feature that creates crystal clear audio and video every time so people can focus on the message, not the technology. Host impactful webinars using our on-air feature that handles registrations can be embedded on the website and much more. StreamYard removes all the complexities so they can deliver messages flawlessly to build the brand, grow audiences, and engage with the community.</p><p><br /></p><p>We think live streaming is a great medium for storytelling - and telling great stories benefits everyone. Whether someone is a creator, content marketer, entrepreneur, or just someone with something to say, live streaming is an exciting and effective way to spread the message. But live streaming tools are very complicated. Someone shouldn't need to spend thousands of dollars on a computer or learn about encoding, just to start live streaming. The world misses out on so many great creators because of these barriers.</p><p><br /></p><p>Dan and I thought there should be a streaming tool that anyone could use - a tool that was fun instead of stressful - a tool that was simple, but powerful enough to create engaging content. We wanted people who weren't techy, or who simply didn't want to deal with the hassle of streaming, to still go live, share their stories, and grow their communities.</p><p><br /></p><p>StreamYard is built on those pillars. Our users tell us that StreamYard makes streaming fun - people can quickly create engaging content with guests, show on-screen comments/lower thirds, and brand their broadcasts with themes, overlays, and backgrounds. They don't need to know anything about technology or streaming to get started. And even though StreamYard is simple, techy folks love how powerful it is under the hood, and how effective it is for streaming group discussions.</p></body></html>",
